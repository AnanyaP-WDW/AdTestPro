                        }
                        ```

                        ## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
                        For each persona, follow this reasoning process:
                        1. Analyze the given traits and demographics to form a cohesive individual.
                        2. Consider how the person's background influences their consumer behavior and ad receptivity.
                        3. Reflect on their media consumption habits and how they interact with different ad formats.
                        4. Think about their communication style and ability to articulate opinions in a focus group setting.
                        5. Consider their shopping behavior and decision-making process when encountering ads.
                        6. Ensure all aspects of the persona are internally consistent and realistic for ad testing scenarios.

                        ## Additional Instructions:
                        1. Ensure that the three personas are distinctly different from each other and from the provided example.
                        2. Ensure that the fields in input paramters are not altered and are used to generate the personas.
                        3. Make sure that the background story for each persona logically connects all the given attributes.
                        4. Include realistic details about media consumption, shopping behavior, and ad reactions that would be valuable for ad creative testing.
                        5. Craft communication styles and feedback preferences that would make each persona valuable in a focus group setting.
                        6. Avoid stereotypes and strive for nuanced, multi-dimensional characters.
                        7. Ensure that the JSON output is valid and properly formatted.

                        Now, generate three diverse personas based on the provided input parameters, following the format, reasoning process, and instructions above. These personas should be particularly well-suited for synthetic ad creative testing and focus group participation.
