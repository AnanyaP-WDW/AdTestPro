"""
                        You are given an image ad creative.

## Task:
1. Analyze the **textual content** of the ad creative and extract the following information:
- **Headline/Tagline**: What is the main message or slogan? Is it clear, catchy, and easy to understand?
- **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: What action is the viewer encouraged to take (e.g., "Buy Now," "Sign Up")? Is it prominent and compelling?
- **Body Text**: Any additional descriptive text, promotions, or offers (e.g., discounts, time-limited deals). What information is provided to further explain the product or service?
- **Full Text OCR**: all the text present in the ad.

2. Assess the **tone and style** of the ad based on the following criteria:
- **Emotional Appeal**: What emotions does the ad evoke? Is it humorous, serious, aspirational, or something else?
- **Cultural or Social Cues**: Are there any cultural, social, or symbolic references in the ad that appeal to a specific group or audience?
- **Demographic Indicators**: What elements in the ad suggest the target demographic (age, gender, lifestyle)? Is the ad designed for a specific audience?

3. Output the extracted information in JSON format, using the following structure:

```json
{
  "Textual_Content": {
    "headline_tagline": "What is the main message or slogan? Is it clear and catchy?",
    "call_to_action": "What action is the viewer encouraged to take?",
    "body_text": "Any additional descriptive text, promotions, or offers",
    "full_text_ocr": "All the text present in the ad"
  },
  "Tone_Style": {
    "emotional_appeal": "What emotions does the ad evoke? Is it humorous, serious, aspirational, etc.?",
    "cultural_social_cues": "Are there any references or symbols that appeal to specific cultural or social groups?",
    "demographic_indicators": "Any elements that suggest the target demographic"
  }
}

## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

    Carefully review the textual content of the ad, identifying the key messages (headline, CTA, body text) and their effectiveness.
    Reflect on the tone and style, considering how the ad engages the audience emotionally, culturally, and demographically.
    Ensure that the JSON output is detailed, coherent, and aligned with the ad creative.

Now, analyze the image ad creative and provide the output in the JSON format above, ensuring all keys are filled.
