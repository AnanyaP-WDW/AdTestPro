## Overview

1. **Target Audience Enrichment**: Users can enter their target audience details. These deatails are used to create [LLM-Simulated Expert Personas] (https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12538v1).

2. **Ad Creative Information Extraction**: The ad creative is analysed to extract critical information needed for qualitative testing ex: tone, visual hierarchies, OCR, branding, demographic indicators, design ,font ,ad dimensions, procilivity towards social media networks etc.

3. **Synthetic Persona Focus Groups**: The generated personas participate in a [focus group survey] (https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/viceprovost/assessment-analysis/assessment-tools-methods/focus-groups/) to provide feedback on the ad creatives. Each persona is shown the ad along with relevant information extracted by an ad/marketing expert. Each persona's confidence and truthfullness are scored. 

4. **Consolidated Feedback**: The responses and feedback from the synthetic personas are collected, analyzed, and presented to the user in an easy-to-understand format.

This allows marketers to get valuable insights into how their target audience might respond to their ads, without the need for a real-world focus group.
